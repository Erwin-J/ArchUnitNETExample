# ArchUnit.NET Example

This project is as example only and part of [this](https://erwinjacobs.dev/blogs/archunitnet-safeguarding-your-architecture-with-rules) blog. The post delves into the significance of maintaining a robust architecture using [ArchUnit.NET](https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnitNET). Dive into this repository to witness basic practical examples of defining and enforcing architectural rules, ensuring your codebase remains resilient to drift.

Example Highlights:

* Define and enforce architectural rules with ArchUnit.NET.
* Execute unit tests to catch architectural violations.
* Play with a sample project structure, testing rules for layers and dependencies.
